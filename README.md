# Coffee Machine Program
## Overview
Hello! I'm Mert, and on Day 15 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge, I am proud to present the "Coffee Machine Program". This Python application simulates a coffee machine, handling various coffee orders, managing resources, and processing transactions. It serves as an excellent project to understand the application of Python in creating interactive programs.

## Required Files and Libraries
To run this coffee machine program, you will need the following files:

### Files:
* resource_and_settings.py: Contains the initial resources for the coffee machine, including water, coffee, and milk quantities, as well as the MENU dictionary with details about different coffee types.
* main.py: The main Python script to run the coffee machine program.
### Python Libraries:
No external libraries are required for this program. It utilizes built-in Python libraries such as sys.
Please ensure these files are in the same directory before running the program.

## Educational Objectives:
This project is designed to apply various Python concepts and functions, including:

* Global Variables: Managing global variables such as resources and their usage across different functions.
* Function Definitions and Calls: Creating and utilizing multiple functions for specific tasks like resource checking, processing user inputs, and calculating change.
* Control Flow: Implementing if/else statements and while loops to control the program's flow based on user input and resource availability.
* Exception Handling: Using try-except blocks for robust input handling and error management.
* Modularity: Breaking down the program into smaller, manageable functions, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
## Key Features
* Resource Management: Monitors and updates the coffee machine's resources like water, coffee, and milk.
* User Interaction: Processes user inputs to select coffee types and handle transactions.
* Transaction Handling: Calculates the total cost, accepts coins, and provides change.
* Customizable Orders: Supports different coffee types with specific resource requirements.
* Maintenance Features: Includes 'report' and 'off' commands for administrative purposes.
## Invitation to Participate
The Coffee Machine Program is a great way to delve into the practical aspects of Python programming. You are invited to explore the functionalities of this application and perhaps even extend it further. Can you optimize resource management or add new features? Dive into this project and enhance your Python coding skills while enjoying a virtual cup of coffee!
